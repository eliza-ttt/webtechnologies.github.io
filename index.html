            <h3>They both die at the end</h3>
            <p>
              Adam Silvera reminds us that there’s no life without death and no
              love without loss in this devastating yet uplifting story about
              two people whose lives change over the course of one unforgettable
              day. <br /><br />
              On September 5, a little after midnight, Death-Cast calls Mateo
              Torrez and Rufus Emeterio to give them some bad news: They’re
              going to die today. <br /><br />
              Mateo and Rufus are total strangers, but, for different reasons,
              they’re both looking to make a new friend on their End Day. The
              good news: There’s an app for that. It’s called the Last Friend,
              and through it, Rufus and Mateo are about to meet up for one last
              great adventure—to live a lifetime in a single day.

              Maybe a killer only looks like a killer in the moment just before,
              during, or after. <br />
              <br />
              Maybe a liar, a good one, never shows it. <br />
              <br />
              Kayla is still holding on to Lainie’s secrets. <br />
              <br />
              After all, Lainie is Kayla’s best friend. And despite Lainie’s
              painful obsession with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, and the
              ways he has tried to come between them, friends don’t spill each
              other’s secrets. They don’t betray each other’s trust. <br />
              <br />
              The murder at the end of the summer doesn’t change all that.
              <br />
              <br />
              Besides—Kayla knows that the truth is not the whole story.

            <h3>The bass rock</h3>
            <p>
              Surging out of the sea, the Bass Rock has for centuries watched
              over the lives that pass under its shadow on the Scottish
              mainland. And across the centuries the fates of three women are
              linked: to this place, to each other.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the early 1700s, Sarah, accused of being a witch, flees for her
              life.

              In the aftermath of the Second World War, Ruth navigates a new
              house, a new husband and the strange waters of the local
              community.
              <br />
              <br />
              Six decades later, the house stands empty. Viv, mourning the death
              of her father, catalogues Ruth’s belongings and discovers her
              place in the past – and perhaps a way forward.
              <br />
              <br />
              Each woman’s choices are circumscribed, in ways big and small, by
              the men in their lives. But in sisterhood there is the hope of
              survival and new life. Intricately crafted and compulsively
              readable, The Bass Rock burns bright with anger and love.

            <h3>The great perhaps</h3>
            <p>
              A breakout new novel from the critically acclaimed novelist and
              playwright Joe Meno, author of Hairstyles of the Damned.
              <br /><br />
              Jonathan, a paleontologist, is searching in vain for a prehistoric
              giant squid; his wife, Madeline, an animal behaviorist, cannot
              explain her failing experiment; their daughter Amelia is a
              disappointed teenage revolutionary; her younger sister, Thisbe, is
              on a frustrated search for God; and their grandfather, Henry,
              wants to disappear, limiting himself to eleven words a day, then
              ten, then nine - one less each day until he will speak no more.
              Each fears uncertainty and the possibilities that accompany it.
              When Jonathan and Madeline suddenly decide to separate, this
              nuclear family is split and forced to confront its own cowardice,
              finally coming to appreciate the cloudiness of this modern age.

            <h3>Okay, so what is this?</h3>
            <p>
              Seven days. Seven days. The Earth might end in seven days.
              <br /><br />
              When news stations start reporting that Earth has been contacted
              by a planet named Alma, the world is abuzz with rumors that the
              alien entity is giving mankind only few days to live before they
              hit the kill switch on civilization.
              <br /><br />
              For high school truant Jesse Hewitt, though, nothing has ever felt
              permanent. Not the guys he hooks up with. Not the jobs his
              underpaid mom works so hard to hold down. Life has dealt him one
              bad blow after another — so what does it matter if it all ends
              now? Cate Collins, on the other hand, is desperate to use this
              time to find the father she’s never met, the man she grew up
              hearing wild stories about, most of which she didn’t believe. And
              then there’s Adeem Khan. While coding and computer programming
              have always come easily to him, forgiveness doesn’t. He can’t seem
              to forgive his sister for leaving, even though it’s his last
              chance.
              <br /><br />
              With only seven days to face their truths and right their wrongs,
              Jesse, Cate, and Adeem’s paths collide even as their worlds are
              pulled apart.

              Growing up in the suburbs of post-war Japan, it seemed to Hajime
              that everyone but him had brothers and sisters. His sole companion
              was Shimamoto, also an only child. Together they spent long
              afternoons listening to her father's record collection. But when
              his family moved away, the two lost touch. Now Hajime is in his
              thirties. After a decade of drifting he has found happiness with
              his loving wife and two daughters, and success running a jazz bar.
              Then Shimamoto reappears. She is beautiful, intense, enveloped in
              mystery. Hajime is catapulted into the past, putting at risk all
              he has in the present.
